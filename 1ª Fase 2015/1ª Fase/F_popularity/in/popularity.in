What about Android? Is it based on Java? I heard from a friend that you can implement native applications with C too.
Really? Man, don't do that. Programming information systems in Java is much better than programming them in C.
I agree with you. But C is the best for scientific applications.
Sure, Java was not created for that.
Do you want to compare Java and C performance? C beats Java for a long distance.
Hey dudes! Why didn't you cite Ruby? It is more productive than Java.
Of course, you do not have to write code... rsrs
Are you sure? What about PHP?
No one is using PHP anymore, wake up!
No one? What about Facebook?
Many online bank services use Java, such as Bradesco.
Do you know if Twitter still uses Scala in its backend?
I'm not sure man. I heard they useJava.
No. They do not useJava. They use Scala.
I'm not sure about that man.
The programming language does not matter. What matter is what you do with them.
I know many programs written in Fortran, Cobol, C, Java, C#, Scala, Pascal...
That does not solve the customer problems. So, does the language matter?
