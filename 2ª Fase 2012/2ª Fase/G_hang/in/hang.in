White man came across the sea Brought us pain and misery Killed our tribes killed our creed Took our game for his own need We fought him hard we fought him well Out on the plains we gave him hell But many came too much for Cree Oh will we ever be set free? Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes Galloping hard on the plains Chasing the redskins back to their holes Fighting them at their own game Murder for freedom the stab in the back Women and children and cowards attack Run to the hills run for your lives

I know you You always rode so tall in the saddle You are the answer But I know that you are only causin' trouble Take all you want, leave me the rest behind You're a user A winnin' no new friends, just make one small step You're a user You never came to anyone's call Spent all your life head on the wall While you're up there, there's only one way to fall All the king's horses and all the king's men Will never put you together again

On a morning from a Bogart movie In a country where they turn back time You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre Contemplating a crime She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running Like a watercolour in the rain Don't bother asking for explanations She'll just tell you that she came In the year of the cat She doesn't give you time for questions As she locks up your arm in hers And you follow 'till your sense of which direction Completely disappears By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls There's a hidden door she leads you to These days, she says, I feel my life Just like a river running through The year of the cat Well, she looks at you so cooly And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea She comes in incense and patchouli So you take her, to find what's waiting inside The year of the cat Well, morning comes and you're still with her And the bus and the tourists are gone And you've thrown away the choice and lost your ticket So you have to stay on But the drum-beat strains of the night remain In the rhythm of the new-born day You know sometime you're bound to leave her But for now you're going to stay In the year of the cat

All through the night as you lie awake and hold yourself so tight What do you need, a second-hand-movie-star to tend you? I as a boy, I believed the saying the cure for pain was love How would it be if you could see the world through my eyes? Too Frightening- the fire's getting colder Too Beautiful- to think you're getting older You're looking for someone to give an answer. But what you see is just an illusion You're surrounded by confusion Saying life's begun to cheat you Friends are out to beat you Grab on to what you can scramble for Don't let the tears... ... just let me know I wanna know...

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die So I might as well begin to put some action in my life Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law So much for the golden future, I can't even start I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law

The sky is red, I don't understand, Past midnight I still see the land. People are sayin' the woman is damned, She makes you burn with a wave of her hand. The city's a blaze, the town's on fire. The woman's flames are reaching higher. We were fools, we called her liar. All I hear is "Burn!" I didn't believe she was devil's sperm. She said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn! When I leave there's no return." The people laughed till she said, "Burn!" Warning came, no one cared. Earth was shakin', we stood and stared. When it came no one was spared. Still I hear "Burn!" You know we had no time, we could not even try. You know we had no time. You know we had no time, we could not even try. You know we had no time. The sky is red, I don't understand, Past midnight I still see the land. People are sayin' the woman is damned, She makes you burn with a wave of her hand. Warning came, no one cared. Earth was shakin, we stood and stared. When it came no one was spared. Still I hear "Burn!"
